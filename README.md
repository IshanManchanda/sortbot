# ðŸ‘‹ Meet Sortbot

The Sortbot wants everything to be in order. Numerical, alphabetical, chronological, and even by surface area, the Sortbot needs everything in its proper place. This API sends you lists to sortâ€”by algorithm or, if you have a lot of time on your hands, manually (who doesnâ€™t want to spend an afternoon sorting 1,000 numbers?). Take the sortbot examâ€”where the sets get more and more complicatedâ€”and compare your speed with other entrants by submitting your completion token to the repository.

## ðŸ“– What can you do?

## âœ¨ A few ideas
- Write a solver in a new-to-you language that accesses the API and returns the data sets correctly sorted.
- Write a browser-based version that enables a human to sort a set themselves and see if they can ever beat a computer.
- Computers are really good at sorting data. What are humans faster at sorting? What can we add to the API that would give a human a change to beat a robot?

## ðŸ¤– API basics
